## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a basic calculator built using Javascript. It was built using a modular, class-based approach.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS v12.16.3
npm (usually comes with node)

### Installing

Running npm install in the command line should take care of all the dependencies.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To run the app locally, type npm run build:dev in the command line to run the dev server.

You can then use the calculator as you would any other calculator :)
